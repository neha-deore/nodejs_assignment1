  --> with the help of http module we create a server 
    --> we define the port 6677 
    --> when path is default (/) we load employee details page (get the data from empdetails.txt file )
        eg:
           Employee Details 
                 Add Employee 
        S.no  Ename  Age   City Salary 
    --> when we click on add employee url is /addemployee 
       Add Employee 
       Ename 
       Age 
       City 
       Salary 
           Submit 
           -> When we click on submit button , store all data in a empdetails.txt file and redirect to default page
